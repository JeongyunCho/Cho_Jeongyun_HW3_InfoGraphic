# Cho Jeongyun HW3 InfoGraphic

The basis of this assignment is to take complex information and present it in the most
efficient and easily understood way

## Infographic Build

Source of the data: WiseApp / Mezo Media

To build this one page Infographic App I used waypoints to trigger the function at certain point of the screen and used TweenMax and TimelineMax which are Greensock libraries that help to animate SVG. I also added some css directly into svg to get the code separate from main files.
